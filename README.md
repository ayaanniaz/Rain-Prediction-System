# Rain-Prediction-System
This project is a machine learning-based rain prediction system that analyzes weather data and predicts the likelihood of rain the next day. The project utilizes logistic regression as the initial baseline model, followed by additional machine learning models to compare performance and analyze predictive accuracy. The dataset used is the "Weather Dataset" from Kaggle, containing historical weather observations from Australia.
